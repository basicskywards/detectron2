### To train the custom Dataset
* [Download dataset here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AUbJBbF7DQx4SLesUQJR1TwZJvVOS71I/view?usp=sharing
)
* Then put the unzipped folder *mini_competition_dataset* in **/datasets/** folder.

### To evaluate the pretrained model
* 1. Install detectron2. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

* 2. Download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j3V5xXgIh2KUPVSANgKwJoTEqajcvfJS/view?usp=sharing)

	* Download and put it in **/tools/ouput/** folder

* 3. To evaluate
	* Go to **/tools/evaluate-MaskRCNN-SubT.ipynb**

Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's next generation software system
that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms.
It is a ground-up rewrite of the previous version,
[Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/),
and it originates from [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/).

### What's New
* It is powered by the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) deep learning framework.
* Includes more features such as panoptic segmentation, densepose, Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, etc.
* Can be used as a library to support [different projects](projects/) on top of it.
  We'll open source more research projects in this way.
* It [trains much faster](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/notes/benchmarks.html).

See our [blog post](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-detectron2-a-pytorch-based-modular-object-detection-library-/)
to see more demos and learn about detectron2.

## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Quick Start

See [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md),
